# Project Plan: NAII Ford Motor

## 1.0 Executive Summary & Vision
* **1.1 Target Market:** Ford Motor Company vehicle platforms (specific model/platform TBD)
* **1.2 Core Value Proposition:** Deliver a motor solution that meets a 1000 W power constraint for integration into Ford vehicles. Specific application (traction drive vs. auxiliary system) TBD.

## 2.0 Key Project Requirements
- Power constraint: 1000 W (define whether this is continuous, peak, or both) — TBD
- Voltage input and electrical architecture (12 V/24 V/48 V/High-voltage) — TBD
- Torque and speed targets; performance curves — TBD
- Duty cycle and thermal limits (continuous operation profile, ambient, temperature rise) — TBD
- Mechanical envelope, mounting interface, shaft geometry — TBD
- Environmental requirements (automotive standards, e.g., ISO 16750; IP rating; corrosion) — TBD
- NVH targets (noise, vibration, harshness) — TBD
- Safety and compliance: Functional Safety (ISO 26262) applicability — TBD
- EMC/EMI compliance (CISPR 25/ISO 11452 or Ford-specific specs) — TBD
- Control strategy and interface (sensorless/sensored, FOC; communications: CAN/LIN/PWM) — TBD
- Cooling strategy (air-cooled/liquid-cooled) — TBD
- Materials and magnet selection (NdFeB grades, alternatives) — TBD
- Reliability and lifetime (MTBF, cycles, warranty targets) — TBD
- Cost targets (BOM and unit cost at volume) — TBD
- Manufacturing considerations (DFM/DFA, supplier constraints) — TBD
- Program timeline and key deliverables — TBD

## 3.0 Architectural Specification
- Motor type candidates: BLDC/PMSM/induction/others — TBD
- Inverter/controller architecture and power stage — TBD
- Feedback/sensing (Hall sensors, encoder, resolver, sensorless) — TBD
- Thermal design and heat sinking — TBD
- Electrical and mechanical interfaces (connectors, harnessing, mounting) — TBD
- Software/firmware requirements (control algorithms, diagnostics, protections) — TBD
- Integration with vehicle systems (power bus, network, safety interlocks) — TBD
